## 2026-09-17 Planner mode is pinned by f orch, not by CLAUDE.md alone
type: decision · goal: manual-2026-09-17 · provenance: repo
- CLAUDE.md:3 — a goal is any change to a repo including the orchestrator itself; first tool call is Skill(orchestrate)
- .claude/hooks/planner-mode.sh — PreToolUse floor: Planner writes only under .orchestrator/ and temp dirs; git commit/add/checkout -b/merge/rebase blocked; push and gh pr allowed because merge() does not push
- .claude/hooks/planner-prompt.sh — UserPromptSubmit reminder on every message; silent for /skill prompts and workers
- dotfiles/config/f/f.sh _f_planner_mode — appended system prompt; goal arg passed as /orchestrate <goal>
outcome: Chosen over trusting CLAUDE.md: on 2026-09-17 the Planner built the memory skill by hand despite the rule. Alternative rejected: --disallowedTools Edit,Write for the Planner, because plan.md and memory need writes and bash heredocs bypass it anyway. Escape hatch ORCH_PLANNER_MODE=0.

## 2026-09-17 Planner may commit, branch and push; still never edits source
type: decision · goal: T-0001 · tasks: T-0002,T-0003 · provenance: repo
- .claude/hooks/planner-mode.sh — git block list is now merge|rebase|cherry-pick|apply|am|reset --hard|filter-branch only (commit b4f03ea by claude:sonnet on account A via executor_fallback, Codex cooling)
- CLAUDE.md:11 Always item 11 — every Planner commit states what/why and gets a dated decisions.md entry naming the revert path
- tests/test_orchestrator.py Guardrails.test_edit_protected_path — path derived from protected-paths.txt (commit 6f6d8cb by claude:sonnet on account B); was checkout-relative and failed the merge gate in every worktree
- merge(T-0003, target=planner-mode) fast-forwarded 2064225..6f6d8cb; PR 2 carries all of it
outcome: Rollback: git revert 6f6d8cb b4f03ea on planner-mode, or close PR 2 unmerged. Alternative rejected: keep commits blocked and have the human commit; the user wants the Planner to do it and be accountable via this record. First real execute run: fallback path, worktree, scope-guard, merge queue all worked; two pre-existing defects found (see gotchas 2026-09-17).

## 2026-09-17 eval 001 passed: status --plain via the full lifecycle
type: decision · goal: T-0004 · tasks: T-0006,T-0011 · provenance: repo
- orchestrator/cli.py:22,30-38 — --plain prints one tab line per account and one for codex (commit 152bcb9 by claude:sonnet via executor_fallback)
- scout T-0006 (account B, 46 s, USD 0.26) located the insertion points; execute T-0011 first try green; merge into goal/T-0004 clean
outcome: Pipeline verified: spawn_scout → spec → fallback executor → external gate → serial merge → goal branch. Rollback: git revert 152bcb9 on goal/T-0004 or close the PR
