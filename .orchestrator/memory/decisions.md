## 2026-09-17 Planner mode is pinned by f orch, not by CLAUDE.md alone
type: decision · goal: manual-2026-09-17 · provenance: repo
- CLAUDE.md:3 — a goal is any change to a repo including the orchestrator itself; first tool call is Skill(orchestrate)
- .claude/hooks/planner-mode.sh — PreToolUse floor: Planner writes only under .orchestrator/ and temp dirs; git commit/add/checkout -b/merge/rebase blocked; push and gh pr allowed because merge() does not push
- .claude/hooks/planner-prompt.sh — UserPromptSubmit reminder on every message; silent for /skill prompts and workers
- dotfiles/config/f/f.sh _f_planner_mode — appended system prompt; goal arg passed as /orchestrate <goal>
outcome: Chosen over trusting CLAUDE.md: on 2026-09-17 the Planner built the memory skill by hand despite the rule. Alternative rejected: --disallowedTools Edit,Write for the Planner, because plan.md and memory need writes and bash heredocs bypass it anyway. Escape hatch ORCH_PLANNER_MODE=0.
